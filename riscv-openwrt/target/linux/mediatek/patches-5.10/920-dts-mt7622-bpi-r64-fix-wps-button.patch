Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: mt7622: fix BPI-R64 WPS button

The bananapi R64 (BPI-R64) experiences wrong WPS button signals.
In OpenWrt pushing the WPS button while powering on the device will set
it to recovery mode. Currently, this also happens without any user
interaction. In particular, the wrong signals appear while booting the
device or restarting it, e.g. after doing a system upgrade. If the
device is in recovery mode the user needs to manually power cycle or
restart it.

The official BPI-R64 sources set the WPS button to GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW in
the device tree. This setting seems to suppress the unwanted WPS button
press signals. So this commit changes the button from GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH to
GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW.

The official BPI-R64 sources can be found on
https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-R64-openwrt
